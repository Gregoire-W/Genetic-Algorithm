    "### Biscuit manufacturing factory problem üç™\n",
    "A biscuit manufacturing factory is gearing up for the festive season by producing a variety of biscuits. The challenge? Maximising biscuit production and profit from a single roll of dough. Here‚Äôs the breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Information: \n",
    "- **Dough Roll Properties**:\n",
    "  - A predefined rectangular length, denoted as **‚ÄòLENGTH‚Äô** (one-dimensional problem).\n",
    "  - Contains **defects** at specific positions (**x**) and of various types (**a**, **b**, **c**, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Biscuits**:\n",
    "  - Can be produced in infinite quantities.\n",
    "  - Have specific **sizes**, **values**, and **defect thresholds** (maximum allowable defects of each class).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints: \n",
    "1. **Placement Rules**:\n",
    "   - Biscuits must be placed at **integer positions**.\n",
    "   - **No overlapping**: Positions occupied by one biscuit cannot be used by another.\n",
    "2. **Defect Tolerance**:\n",
    "   - A biscuit‚Äôs defect limits must not be exceeded for the positions it covers.\n",
    "3. **Length Limitation**:\n",
    "   - The total size of the biscuits cannot exceed the dough roll‚Äôs length.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution Value: \n",
    "- The value of a solution = **sum of biscuit values** ‚Äì **penalty for unused dough** (-1 per empty position).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Benchmark:\n",
    "- **Roll Length**: 500 units.\n",
    "- **Defects**: 3 classes (a, b, c), details in `defects.csv`.\n",
    "- **Biscuits**:  \n",

    "### What are Genetic Algorithms (GAs)?\n",
    "Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are optimisation techniques inspired by **natural selection**. They simulate the process of evolution to find solutions to complex problems. GAs are particularly effective for large search spaces and problems with multiple constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps in GAs:\n",
    "1. **Initialisation** üîÑ:\n",
    "   - Start with a randomly generated population of potential solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Evaluation** üíØ:\n",
    "   - Calculate the fitness of each solution (e.g., total value of biscuits ‚Äì penalties).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Selection** ü•á:\n",
    "   - Choose the best solutions based on fitness to form the next generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Crossover** üîó:\n",
    "   - Combine parts of two solutions (parents) to produce new solutions (children).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Mutation** üçÄ:\n",
    "   - Introduce small changes to solutions to explore new possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Termination** ‚è≥:\n",
    "   - Stop when a satisfactory solution is found or after a predefined number of generations.\n",
